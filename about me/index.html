    <h3>Avee</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Flourish, Some might call me Avee. I'm from Nigeria. I currently work as an online marketer. <br> is to get a degree in Web and Computer Development which I am currently doing. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for 13 years. I've grown very fond of the prophets and apostles, I like to listen to them very often. <br>I served my mission in Nigeria (re-assignment due to Co-vid 19) and Ghana from 2020 till 2022.</p>
    <p>I've always loved computers and wanted to know how softwares are designed that why I chose this course. <br>Hope to get to know y'all better.</p>
